# K-Means-Clustering-with-DTW-Metric


Implemented the DTW algorithm to find the best alignment between time series data using dynamic programming algorithms very similar to the needleman-wunsch algorithm. This DTW distance was then used to classify the time series data using KNN, with comparable performance to LSTM models classifying the same. 
I also implemented multiprocessing to help speed up the calculations and further reduce computation time.
